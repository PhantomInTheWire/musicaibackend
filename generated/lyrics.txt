In the shadows of power, two leaders align
A bond of trust, a friendship divine
Putin and Modi, a unlikely pair
United by interests, beyond compare

From defense to trade, their ties run deep
A strategic partnership, in a world asleep
India's oil imports, a lifeline to Russia's shore
A vital partner, in a global game once more

Despite the criticism, they stand as one
A calculated gamble, in a diplomatic sun
Their personal rapport, a beacon of hope
A symbol of India's independence, a scope

In a complex web, of global intrigue
Their friendship stands, a nuanced dialogue
With China and the West, a delicate dance
India's balancing act, a strategic prance

Through the noise of geopolitics, they find common ground
A mutual respect, that echoes all around
Their bond remains strong, a testament to their might
A partnership that shapes, the future's light.
